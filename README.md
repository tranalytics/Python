# Python
Some of My Work in Pyhton
Social Code analysis is exploratory data analysis for an interview project

Data Mining is functions that I have created to mine sports reference network with a focus on basketball reference for now

Machine Learning is porting my R machine learning skills into Python

All codes are work in progress and I do not use GitHub as my main code folder, so I will most likely have made progress on what is published.
